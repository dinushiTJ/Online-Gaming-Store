# Online-Gaming-Store
The system for the online gaming store is a group project developed using JAVA but here I attached the part that I have completed (JSP and Servelets) according to MVC architecture. Bootstrap, HTML, CSS and JavaScript were used to develop the front-end of this application. Plus, for back-end was implemented by using JSP and Servelets on Apache Tomcat Server. The database was implemented using MYSQL via PHPMYAdmin.
